<h3>Text Statistics</h3>
<p><strong>Zipf's Law: The observation that the distribution of word frequencies is very skewed. In fact, the
two most frequent words in English ("the" and "of") account for about 10% of all
word occurrences. The most frequent six words account for 20% of occurrences,
and the most frequent 50 words are about 40% of all text! On the other hand,
given a large sample of text, typically about one half of all the unique words in
that sample occur only once. </strong></p>
