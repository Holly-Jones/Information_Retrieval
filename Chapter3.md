<p>Each web page on the Internet has its own unique uniform resource locator, or
URL. Any URL used to describe a web page has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the scheme (HTTP):</strong> Web pages are stored on web servers,
which use a protocol called Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, to exchange
informatio n with client software. Therefore, most URLs used on the Web start
with the scheme http , indicating that the URL represents a resource that can
be retrieved using HTTP. </li>
<br>
<li><strong>the hostname:</strong> The hostname follows, which is the name of the computer that is running the web server that holds this web page. In the figure, the
computer's name is www. cs. umass. edu, which is a computer in the University of
Massachusetts Computer Science department. </li>
<br>
<li><strong>resource name: </strong>This URL refers to a page on that
computer called /csinfo/people.html.</li>
