<h1>Processing Text</h1>

<h3>Text Statistics</h3>
<p><strong>Zipf's Law:</strong> The observation that the distribution of word frequencies is very skewed. In fact, the
two most frequent words in English ("the" and "of") account for about 10% of all
word occurrences. The most frequent six words account for 20% of occurrences,
and the most frequent 50 words are about 40% of all text! On the other hand,
given a large sample of text, typically about one half of all the unique words in
that sample occur only once. </p>

<p><strong>In mathematical terms, Zipf's law states that "the frequency of the rth most common word is inversely proportional
to r or, alternatively, the rank of a word times its frequency (/) is approximately
a constant (fc)".</strong></p>

<h3>Link Analysis</h3>
<p>Links are a powerfu l navigational aid for people browsing the Web, but they also help search engines understand the relationships between the pages. <strong>These detected relationships help search engines rank web pages more effectively. </strong></p>

<br>

<h3>Anchor Text</h3>
<p>Anchor text has two properties that make it particularly useful for ranking web
pages. First, it tends to be very short, perhaps two or three words, and those
words ofte n succinctly describe the topic of the linked page. For instance, links
to www.ebay.com are highly likely to contain the word "eBay" in the anchor text.
<strong>Many queries are very similar to anchor text in that they are also short topical descriptions of web pages.</strong> </p>
